My name is Michael Yanovich.<br /><br />
I am a programmer, and I have a full time job doing what I love, programming. For my day job I mostly do programming in PHP or Python, in my free time I almost exclusively do Python now. I've done C++, Perl, and a little javascript. I'm planning on revisiting C++ in the near future.
<br />
I do not have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, and I don't "technically" have a <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, though my IRC bot <a href="https://twitter.com/jenni_bot">jenni</a> has one. (It's mostly a stream of git commits for her.)
