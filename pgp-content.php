We are having a PGP Signing Party on January 13, 2011 and everyone is invited.
<br><br>
This will be where people can show up and have other people in the area verify who you are and sign your PGP key if they choose to.
<br><br>
We'll try to follow this form of a PGP signing party: <a href="http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/keysigning_party/en/keysigning_party.html#traditional">Informal / Traditional</a>
<br>
Please bring at least one form of identification that is issued by a government entity, two forms would be preferred.

We will have the PGP signing party after our regularly scheduled meeting. Our regularly scheduled meetings start at 7:00PM and usually last about an hour or two. Our topic for that night will be GIMP. Also we usually have pizza sometime between 7:30PM and 8:30PM depending on when there is a good 'break' point in the presentation.
